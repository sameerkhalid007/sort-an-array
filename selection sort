"""
There are many different ways to sort the cards.
Here's a simple one, called selection sort.

1. Find the smallest element. Swap it with the first element in an array.
2. Find the second-smallest element. Swap it with the second element in an array.
3. Find the third-smallest element. Swap it with the third element in an array.
4. Repeat finding the next-smallest element, and swapping it into the correct position until the array is sorted.

This algorithm is called selection sort because it repeatedly selects the next-smallest element and swaps it into place.
